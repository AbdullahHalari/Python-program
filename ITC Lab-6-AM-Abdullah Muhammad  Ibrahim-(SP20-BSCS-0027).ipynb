The read function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string. If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).\n",

Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command out_file.write(k + \",\" + v + \"\\n\"). This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.\n",

    "The loading portion is a little more complicated. It starts by getting a file object. Then it uses a while True: loop to keep looping until a break statement is encountered. Next it gets a line with the line in_line = in_file.readline(). The readline function will return an empty string when the end of the file is reached. The if statement checks for this and breaks out of the while loop when that happens. Of course if the readline function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what readline returns. Hence we have to get rid of the newline. The line in_line = in_line[:-1] does this for us by dropping the last character. Next the line name, number = in_line.split(\",\") splits the line at the comma into a name and a number. This is then added to the numbers dictionary.\n",
